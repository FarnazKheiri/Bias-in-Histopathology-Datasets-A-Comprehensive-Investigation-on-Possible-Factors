## KimiaNet Feature Filtering
This section contains a Python script to filter training, testing, or validation of TCGA features extracted by KimiaNet. This function filters the dataset for medical centers that contribute more than 40 slides and processes the corresponding features. The features are loaded from pre-saved pickle files for each slide.
